## Simple pendulum simulation with VTK
Graphical simulation in C++ of the movement of a gravitational pendulum using VTK library. The similation perform two types of oscillation : undamped oscillation and damped oscillation.
### Commands
- s : start simulation
- n : undamped oscillation
- d : damped oscillation
